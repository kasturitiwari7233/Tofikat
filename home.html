        <h2> üòç Happy 1 Year Anniversary! üòç </h2>
        <p>Dear Tofi,
        <p>Happy Anniversary!!!</p>
        <p>It is officially an year from the day when you stole my heart and soul from me with a kiss and a cheesy line in Spanish,
        but I couldn‚Äôt be happier that you did. Without you I don‚Äôt know how I could‚Äôve even made it this far.</p>
        <p>There is a lot I want to say and I know we have a lifetime for me to express everything you make me feel. 
        So for now I will just say that I love you. I love you so fucking much and I always will no matter what happens.
        I hope you know that and any time that you think otherwise just come to me and I will remind you again and again 
        till it is ingrained in your brain.</p>
        <p>Now enjoy this chotu website that I could make for you with my limited knowledge and help from our ChatGPT uncle.</p>
        <p>Once again HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!</p>
        <p>With all my love,</p>
        <p>Kat</p>
